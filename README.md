React + Vite
Project Name
My App

I built this project using a component-based structure to keep the code clean and reusable.
I applied responsive design principles and TailwindCSS utilities to ensure smooth adaptation across all screen sizes.
Animations were implemented using CSS and custom keyframes for smooth and continuous motion effects.
